This application automatically deploys a VPN server on a cloud service provider (only AWS is currently supported).
The application manages the VPN connection and allows the user to filter DNS traffic and view statistcs about their network usage. 



Creating Access/Secret Key

Log into AWS
Go to IAM (Identity and Access Management) Dashboard
Go to users tab on the left side of the screen, found between User Groups and Roles options under Access Management
Create a new user, giving it a name and allowing access to AWS management console (not required)
Set the permissions as "Attach Polcicies Directly", giving it one policy of AmazonEC2FullAccess, ignore permission boundaries
Review and create the user
Click on the user and press create access key on the right side of the summary box
For Access key best practices & alternatives, select "Application running outside AWS"
Add description tag (not required)
The keys are now created, save them in a secure location, these will be used to log into the VPN program
The secret key can not be seen again after exiting the tab
Do not put the keys in a public spot or in code, as other people who have access to the key can use it to create servers, and can lead to excess charges on bank account
The access key will be in the Access Token Box, while the Secret key will be used in the Secret Token box
