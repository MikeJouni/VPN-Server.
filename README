CIS 375 Group Project
This application automatically deploys a VPN server on a cloud service provider (currently, only AWS is supported). The application manages the VPN connection, allows the user to filter DNS traffic, and provides statistics about their network usage.

Creating Access/Secret Key
To create an Access and Secret Key in AWS for use with the VPN application, follow these steps:

Log into AWS:

Go to the AWS Management Console at AWS Console.
Navigate to IAM (Identity and Access Management) Dashboard:

In the AWS Management Console, go to IAM (Identity and Access Management).
Find IAM in the services menu or use the search bar.
Create a New User:

Go to the Users tab on the left side of the screen, between User Groups and Roles under Access Management.
Click Add user.
Choose a user name and allow access to the AWS Management Console (optional).
Set Permissions:

Set the permissions as Attach policies directly.
Select the AmazonEC2FullAccess policy to grant full EC2 access.
Ignore permission boundaries for now.
Review and Create the User:

Review the information, and create the user.
After creating the user, click on the user’s name to view the details.
Generate Access and Secret Keys:

On the user’s summary page, click Create access key on the right side.
For best practices and alternatives, select Application running outside AWS.
Optionally, add a description tag (not required).
The Access Key ID and Secret Access Key will be generated.
Save these keys in a secure location immediately as the secret key will not be shown again after closing the tab.
Important Security Notes:

Do not put your keys in a public spot or in your code. If someone else gains access to your keys, they could use them to create servers and cause excessive charges on your account.
The Access Key will be used in the Access Token box, while the Secret Key will be entered in the Secret Token box within the VPN application.
