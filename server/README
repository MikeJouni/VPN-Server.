Dev/Testing Server setup:

1. Create AWS EC2 instance
    - Ubuntu 24.04 (ami-0ea3c35c5c3284d82)
    - Type: t2.micro
    - Security Group: Allow UDP 500 and UDP 4500 from any ipv4/ipv6

2. Use ssh to connect to server
    - $ ssh -i <keyfile> ubuntu@<serverIP>

3. Clone github repo
    - $ git clone https://github.com/nowickit-umich/CIS375GroupProject.git

4. Run setup script
    - $ sudo chmod +x CIS375GroupProject/server/setup.sh
    - $ sudo ./CIS375GroupProject/server/setup.sh
    - Enter a password when prompted. This will be the password used to connect to the VPN.

NOTES:
IP address is listed in instance summary. This IP address will change if the server is stopped or restarted.
If the IP address changes, the setup script must be run again.

VPN client settings:
IKEv2

The server certificate can be found on the server in /etc/swanctl/x509/cert.pem
